# DeepVision Project

DeepVision is an innovative open-source project dedicated to advancing computer vision technology by integrating deep learning, serverless computing, hybrid AI, and intent-based frameworks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will cover serveral cognitive synergy use cases

### Prerequisites

### Running the project

To run the project, use the `docker-compose up` command followed by the service name. Here are some examples:

1. To bring up the hybridaiobjectdetection configuration, run `docker-compose up hybridaiobjectdetection`
2. To bring up the hybridaiobjecttracking configuration, run `docker-compose up hybridaiobjecttracking`

If you want to run the services in the background, you can add the `-d` option:

1. To bring up the hybridaiobjectdetection configuration in detached mode, run `docker-compose up -d hybridaiobjectdetection`
2. To bring up the hybridaiobjecttracking configuration in detached mode, run `docker-compose up -d hybridaiobjecttracking`

To stop the services, run `docker-compose down`.
