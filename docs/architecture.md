### Video Source Service:

The Video Source Service is responsible for collecting video streams from various sources, such as cameras or files, and pushing the data into a Redis database. In addition, it stores metadata into another Redis database.

This service is implemented as a Docker container.

### Video Tracking Service:

The Video Tracking Service is based on the open mmlab tracker. It takes an input stream from Redis and adds tracking information to the stream, which is then saved back to Redis.

After the Video Tracking Service has processed the data, consumers are able to view the data in the Redis stream (which now includes tracking information) and the metadata through Grafana dashboards and annotated video servers, as well as any Android or React applications.

Similar to the Video Source Service, the Video Tracking Service and Redis databases are also running as Docker containers.

## PRODUCER:

This is a Python script that allows the user to capture video frames from either a webcam or a local video file and send them to a Redis server to create a video stream. Here is a summary of the code's architecture:

1. The code imports argparse, cv2, logging, redis, time, and pickle libraries. It also imports the urlparse module from the urllib.parse library.
2. The code defines a Video class, which initializes the video capture object, sets video resolution and frame rate, and implements the iteration method that reads the video frames.
3. The code parses command-line arguments using the argparse library.
4. The code establishes a Redis connection using the Redis library and sets up the video source depending on the arguments passed in.
5. The code captures video frames, encodes them as a binary string using the pickle library, and sends them to the Redis server using the xadd method

## TRACKER:

1. The code uses the mmtracking library to perform multi-object tracking on video frames. The mmtracking library provides a high-level API for multi-object tracking, making it easier to implement complex tracking algorithms.
2. The code accepts command-line arguments using the argparse library. The command-line arguments specify the input stream key for the video frames, the class category of the objects to track, the output stream key for the tracklets, the checkpoint file for the model, the device used for inference, the Redis URL for storing the data, and the maximum length of the output stream.
3. The code uses Redis as a data store to manage the input and output streams of video frames and tracklets. Redis is a popular in-memory data store that is often used in real-time data processing applications.
4. The code uses a custom GPUCalculator class and MMTMonitor class to monitor the GPU usage and track the latency of model inference and bounding box calculations. These classes provide valuable insights into the performance of the tracking algorithm and help identify potential bottlenecks in the system.
5. The code uses the results2outs function to convert the output of the tracking algorithm into a dictionary format that can be easily serialized and stored in Redis. The function extracts the bounding box coordinates and object IDs from the tracking results and stores them in a list of dictionaries. The list of dictionaries is then converted to a JSON string and stored in Redis as a stream of tracklets.

## SERVER:

1. RedisImageStream class is defined to fetch the latest image and tracking information from Redis database.
2. A Flask web application is used to create a video stream of the image feed by continuously sending the latest image to the client.
3. TrackletManager class is used to manage the tracking information of the objects in the image feed.
4. The gen() function is used to generate a continuous stream of JPEG frames, which are then sent to the client using the Response class.
5. The code uses various libraries such as OpenCV, PIL, NumPy, and seaborn for image processing, color palette generation, and drawing bounding boxes and tails on the objects being tracked in the image feed.
